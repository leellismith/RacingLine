## Notes
I wanted to remove the orange border when the input field was selected and found out how to do it on (https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-remove-and-style-the-border-outline-around-text-input-boxes-in-google-chrome.html)

I wanted to add a label input where you could select an amount for people booking (<https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/forms/overview/>)

I Had issues with the three boxes in track details. after researching on (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and trial and error on developer tools, I managed to get the boxes to be reactive with enlarging website.
