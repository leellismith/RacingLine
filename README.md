### __Lighthouse Testing__

### __Home Page Testing__

![First Home Page Testing](assets/images/testing/firstlighthousetestindex.JPG)

    As you can see from the testing images the home page performance was at 86 after 
    looking in to the issue it seems that this was because of the image file sizes.
    After compressing the image the performace and after added meta description both scores 
    have improved as you can see in the second lighthouse test below.

### __Gallery Page Testing__

![First Gallery Page Testing](assets/images/testing/galleryfirsttest.JPG)

    As you can from the the testing on the gallery page the performance is a little 
    low as the image size where too large. After compressing images this has improved the performance.

### __Booking Page Testing__

![Booking Page Testing](assets/images/testing/bookingfirsttest.JPG)

    The booking page testing was very good from the start but could be improved once again by
    compressing the image file.

# Test Cases

# Fixed Bugs

  * Fixed isses with image scaling in gallery by added media query at different sizes.

  * I Had issues with the three boxes in track details. after researching on (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and trial and error on developer tools, I managed to get the boxes to be reactive with enlarging website.

 * Had a bug with the Form where on the smaller screens it would start to overlap.

 ![Form Bug](assets/images/testing/formbug.JPG)

* I fixed this issue by adding padding to the bottom of the form.
